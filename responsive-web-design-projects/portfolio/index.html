      <h1>About Jeffery L. Graham</h1>
      <div class="info">
        <p>
          Hello everybody. I’m Jeffery L. Graham, a web developer. I’ve always
          liked building stuff. Ever since I was little kid with Legos, building
          anything my mind could come up with. I’ve also always liked putting
          together puzzles. I remember putting puzzles under the bed in the room
          I shared with my 2 brothers. That was the only space in our small
          apartment I was sure that the puzzle wouldn’t get messed with.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, as an adult, I still like building things and solving puzzles. But
          now instead of bricks & puzzle pieces, I use code & programming. That
          transition started 20 years ago when I was building websites on Angelfire
          in my dorm room on Friday nights when most of my friends were out drinking.
          And even though I ended up going into education after college, my
          affinity for coding and building stuff never died. From free sites, like
          the Odin Project & freeCodeCamp, to paid sites, like from Udemy, Udacity,
          Treehouse, I’ve continued to learn how to build stuff on the web, but
          most importantly, how to do it properly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, let put all my knowledge & experience into building cool stuff for you.
        </p>
